# Scientific project: Automated watering system.

For our course "Scientific project" we had to work out a system that automatically waters plants. While my colleague Wolf worked on the Mechanical side of the project, I developed the in-depth control interface (A website) on which the user is able to read out and set different parameters for each individual row of plants. 

With this website, you could also make different watering schedules (time of day, amount, ...) for each individual row of plants.

To realize this I used: Python, FastAPI, HTML, css, javascript, bootstrap, RPi.GPIO, Adafruit_GPIO.SPI, Adafruit_MCP3008
